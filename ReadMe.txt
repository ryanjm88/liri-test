// This app allows users to look up music tracks, movie stats, and my tweets from the console using the Spotify, OMDB, and Twitter APIs.

// Commands

// "movie-this" // Looks up movie's statistics on OMDB by typing in its title. Titles with more than one word will have to have a hyphen to replace blank spaces, such as "A-Quiet-Place"

// "spotify-this-song" // Shows top five tracks for track title entered. Again, titles with more than one word will have to have a hyphen to replace blank spaces.

// "my-tweets // Displays my (Ryan's) 20 most recent tweets. Be prepared!

// "do-what-it-says" // Pulls data from text file to be used by Spotify's API to look up track "I Want It That Way".

// Please see the "OMDB", "Spotify", and "Tweets" PNG files for examples of how these commands work.
